# Deep_Learning

## Overview

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks) to model and understand complex patterns in data. 
It is highly effective in a variety of tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more. 
Deep learning algorithms have gained popularity due to their ability to handle large datasets and perform tasks that were previously infeasible with traditional Machine Learning approaches.

The goal of deep learning is to create models that can automatically learn high-level features from data, making it possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance in different applications.
